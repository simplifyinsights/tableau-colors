# Tableau Colors

A collection of Tableau Color palettes for use.

## Material Design

The Google Material Design colour palette comprises primary and accent colours that can be used for illustration or to develop your brand colours. They have been designed to work harmoniously with each other. The colour palette starts with primary colours and fills in the spectrum to create a complete and usable palette for Android, Web, and iOS. Google suggests using the 500 colours as the primary colours in your app and the other colours as accents colours.
