# Tableau Colors

A collection of Tableau Color palettes for use.

## Material Design

The Google Material Design colour palette comprises primary and accent colours that can be used for illustration or to develop your brand colours. They have been designed to work harmoniously with each other. The colour palette starts with primary colours and fills in the spectrum to create a complete and usable palette for Android Web, and iOS. Google suggests using the 500 colours as the primary colours in your app and the other colours as accents colours.

## iOS

Color is a great way to impart vitality, provide visual continuity, communicate status information, give feedback in response to user actions, and help people visualize data. Look to the systemâ€™s color scheme for guidance when picking app tint colors that look great individually and in combination, on both light and dark backgrounds.
